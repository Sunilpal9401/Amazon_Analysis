SQL Project : Unveiling Insights from Amazon Superstore Data
This report leverages the power of SQL to delve into the Amazon Superstore dataset, uncovering hidden patterns and actionable insights to optimize sales, marketing, and inventory management. Through meticulous querying, data manipulation, and analysis, we expose key trends in customer behavior, product performance, and pricing strategies. Armed with these insights, we present concrete recommendations to propel Amazon's superstores to even greater heights.
Methodology
•	Data Acquisition: We utilized the publicly available Amazon Superstore dataset, encompassing sales, customer, product, and geographical information.
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We employed SQL functions and joins to address missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate entries.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We crafted SQL queries to generate descriptive statistics, identify outliers, and visualize data trends through aggregations and joins.
•	Statistical Analysis: We used SQL functions and windowing techniques to calculate sales growth, customer segmentation metrics, and product performance measures.
•	Advanced Analysis: We employed self-joins and subqueries to explore deeper relationships, such as customer lifetime value and basket analysis.
Key Findings (Focus on SQL-driven insights)
•	Customer Segmentation: Using SQL functions like COUNTIF and GROUP BY, we identified distinct customer segments based on purchase frequency and average order value.
•	Top-Selling Products: Through queries involving SUM, GROUP BY , ORDER BY, we pinpointed the top-selling products and categories, revealing hidden gems and potential opportunities.
•	Price Sensitivity: Employing SQL joins and windowing functions, we analyzed the impact of pricing on sales across different product categories and customer segments.
•	Promotional Effectiveness: Utilizing CASE statements and conditional joins,Sub-Queries,CTE’s,Views, transactions, I evaluated the effectiveness of various promotional campaigns, identifying the most impactful strategies
This SQL-powered analysis has unlocked a treasure trove of insights into the inner workings of Amazon's superstores. By embracing the power of SQL queries, we have identified key areas for improvement and provided actionable recommendations to optimize sales, marketing, and inventory management. By continuously iterating and refining these SQL-driven strategies, Amazon can solidify its position as a leader in the e-commerce landscape.
